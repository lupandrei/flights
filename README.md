# flights
This project involves the development of a Java-based flight management system with an intuitive graphical user interface. Users can filter flights based on location and date and purchase tickets for the desired flights.

The system will validate input data and perform all processing at the service or controller level, with data interaction through the repository.

PostgreSQL will be used as the backend database.

The system will also implement pagination and automatically update the number of available seats for a flight when a ticket is purchased by authenticated clients
